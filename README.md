reverse-filenames
=================

Bash script for changes all filenames in the current dir to reverse filenames.
The script skips folders, only changes files.
While executing it will show a progress bar and show stats when it is finished.

In a Debian environment you can put this in /usr/local/bin/ to make this available for all users on the server.
Dont forget to give the file the right ownership and rights, the script needs to be executable.
After that you can call the filename (reverse-filenames) in your current dir and thats it.
