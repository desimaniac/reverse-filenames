reverse-filenames
=================

Bash script for changes all filenames in the current dir to reverse filenames.
Skips folders while changing filenames and it will show progress bar and stats when finished.

In a Debian environment you can put this in /usr/local/bin/ to make this available for all users on the server.
Dont forget to give the file the right ownership and rights, the script needs to be executable.
After that you can call the filename (reverse-filenames) in your current dir and thats it.
